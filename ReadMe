YP Clock Sim is a clock simulator that consists of a clock, a countdown timer and alarm clock. The alarm clock lets you choose your own mp3 song as alarm tone and also remembers your alarm setting.

It can be useful when you are in computer and want to use it for specific amount of time.. but don't know the passage of time. It pops up and plays a song for your alarm time.

It also has minimize to system tray feature when you press minimize button. Keeps your taskbar neat and less crowded :D. plus you might forget the app is running but it won't forget the time ;)

I am posting source codes along with the main program. It has been written in VB and has been written in a simple format :)

Requirements:

    Windows Xp or higher
    net framework 3.5 or higher
    128mb ram
